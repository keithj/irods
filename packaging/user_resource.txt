Welcome to iRODS.

This installation of a resource server is currently incomplete.

The following script will prompt for necessary iRODS iCAT server
information and then populate your server_config.json accordingly:

  sudo /var/lib/irods/packaging/setup_irods.sh

This will result in a running resource server with a default
resource named with your hostname concatenated with "Resource"
and a local vault in /var/lib/irods/iRODS/Vault.

Please consult the documentation for further configuration details.
