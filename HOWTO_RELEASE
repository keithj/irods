iRODS is designed to be tested via a Continuous Integration (CI) server.

Theoretically, this means that a release can be cut whenever the build and test infrastructure is green.

This, in turn, makes the decision to cut a release a management/marketing decision and not a technical decision.

---------------------------

The CI system is watching a branch of the code named 'automated_release'.

When this branch is updated, a series of actions are set in motion, culminating in a release being put onto the RENCI public ftp site.

To create a new release:

0 - Make sure you're in the master branch
    $ git checkout master
1 - Decide which commit is the one (if it's not the HEAD of master)
    $ git log
    $ git checkout COMMITSHA1
2 - Tag it
    $ git tag TAGNAME -a -m"TAG MESSAGE HERE"
    $ git tag -l -n
3 - Move the automated_release branch forward to the designated spot
    $ git checkout automated_release
    $ git rebase TAGNAME
4 - Push the updates to the agreed upon remote
    $ git push
    $ git push --tags


From here, the automated system should take over and kick into gear.

Then, manually...

- upload new documentation to irods.org
- update irods.org/download
- post announcement as irods.org blog post
- post announcement to irod-chat@googlegroups.com
